From July to September 2023 (coinciding with the harvest season for Agropastoral livelihoods and the lean season for pastoral livelihoods), approximately 2.8 million people (17 percent of the ASAL population) are classified in [IPC](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1156542/) Acute Food Insecurity (AFI) Phase 3 or above (Crisis or worse) of these 2.3 million people are in IPC Phase 3, Crisis and close to 500,000 people in IPC Phase 4, Emergency. Compared to the situation in the last analysis (short rains assessment), there has been a general improvement across the ASAL counties, from 4.4 million people in IPC AFI Phase 3 or above in February 2023 and 5.4 million in March – June 2023 to 2.8 million in the current period of this analysis. This improvement largely results from a good harvest across the ASALs supported by favourable rainfall. 

Nevertheless, a combination of shocks continues to hinder many households’ food security, in particular high staple food prices catalysed by rising inflation. Based on the analysis, around eight predominantly pastoral livelihood counties are classified in IPC AFI Phase 3 (Crisis), and six counties have recorded at least 30 percent of the population in IPC Phase 3 or above: Mandera (30 percent), Samburu (30 percent), Wajir (30 percent), Garissa (35 percent), Turkana (35 percent) and Marsabit (40 percent).

In the projection period, October 2023 to January 2024, despite the seasonal improvements, Turkana, Marsabit, and Mandera will likely remain in IPC AFI Phase 3. At the same time, the other counties are likely to improve to IPC Phase 2, Stressed. Approximately 1.5 million people have classified in IPC Phase 3 or above; of these, 266,000 people are classified in IPC Phase 4, Emergency and 1.3 million are classified in IPC Phase 3, Crisis. Despite some factors having shown improvements, like livestock prices, it was clear that the impacts of drought have affected livelihoods, with livestock populations being in stock, significantly smaller areas under cultivation resulting from reduced purchasing power of inputs and reluctance to invest back in agriculture after the previous consecutive failures.

The Kenya Education in Emergencies Working Group (EiE WG) — a coordination body made up of national and international NGOs, UN agencies, and government — is co-led by the Ministry of Education, Save the Children, and UNICEF.
